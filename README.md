# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In the modules this week, we created a SQL database to manage data for employees of Pewlett-Hackard. In the past, they managed their employee data through Excel and VBA.  We have already analyzed the counts of employees who are likely to retire soon by department, and determined how many of these are managers. In our new analysis we have made two new analyses: the number of prospective employees by job title, and the number of employees eligible for a proposed mentorship program.  Both of these new analyses should help Pewlett-Hackard start preparing for the big wave of retirements that will begin soon.
